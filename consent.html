                                <b>“The Global A-T Family Data Platform”</b> initiative is a patient-driven effort, overseen by ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) research advocates that will empower A-T patients and their families to help transform research and treatment of the disease by sharing their genetic data and related health information with researchers around the world. If families also agree to allow researchers to re-contact them with follow-up research questions, the platform will enable the A-T community to have a continuous dialogue with researchers and potentially accelerate progress in A-T research. The ultimate goal of this effort is to create an environment in which the A-T patient community and their families contribute their clinical and genetic data and govern the sharing of these data with researchers to better understand the disease.<br><br>

                                initiative?</h2>
                            We want to better understand genetic and other biological and lifestyle-related factors
                            affecting A-T patients so that we can work toward developing more effective therapies and
                            diagnostics. By partnering directly with patients, and enabling an ongoing dialogue with
                            researchers, we will be able to study many more cases worldwide and create a comprehensive
                            and evolving resource for A-T genetics and health characteristics. This is a critical step
                            toward developing potential therapies and improving care.

                            participate, you can always change your mind and ask that your data no longer be shared. You
                            can also choose not to receive additional communication about future studies. Your medical
                            care will not change whether you participate or not.

                            Participating in this study may not improve your own health. The information we collect may
                            aid in research efforts to provide better A-T treatment and prevention options to patients
                            in the future. We will provide updates on our website about key research discoveries made
                            possible by your participation. We will not be able to provide you with any specific
                            information about your own genetic data. If, at some point in the future, we believe that
                            analysis of your genetic results may impact or change your diagnosis of A-T, we will contact
                            your doctor, if you have agreed to this beforehand.
                            <h2 class="Subtitle Wizard-subtitle">5. What are the risks of taking part in this research
                                initiative?</h2>
                            There is a potential risk that your information (which includes information from your health
                            records and possibly your genetic information) could be seen by unauthorized individuals. An
                            accidental release of your genetic information could be used to identify you and your family
                            members. However, we have tried to minimize this risk by carefully limiting access to the
                            computers that would house your information to the staff of this research initiative as well
                            as by creating secured access-controlled software that will hold information about your
                            personal identity (e.g. name, date of birth, address) in an encrypted manner.
                            <h2 class="Subtitle Wizard-subtitle">6. Will it cost me anything to participate in this

                            information will be only available to study staff at the A-T Children’s Project who have
                            signed confidentiality agreements and have received special training), your genomic data and
                            health information will be made available to researchers around the world through a secure,
                            access-controlled data repository developed and operated by the Broad Institute of MIT and
                            Harvard. Your data can only be accessed by qualified investigators who have been granted
                            permission by a data access committee selected by the A-T Children’s Project, comprised of
                            A-T family members as well as scientific and medical advisors. We will keep track of every
                            study that has used your information.

                            Yes, you can withdraw from this research study at any time, and your data will no longer be
                            shared with researchers in future research studies. However, any of your information that
